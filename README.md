This is an assignment from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>

The goal of the assignment is to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game utilizing HTML & Javascript. There wont be any CSS, so it's not going to look pretty. The game will have no GUI, and will utilize the browser's console. The purpose of the assignment is to practice using basic Javascript.
