# rock-paper-scissors
This is an assignment from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>

The goal of the assignment is to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This assignment is in two parts. 

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors">Part 1</a> is creating the project using only HTML and Javascript, and having no GUI and only using the Console.

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors">Part 2</a> is revisiting the project, and adding a GUI to the project. This is done through DOM manipulation to add buttons.
